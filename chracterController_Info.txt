This is a basic character controller script for unity2D

this script contain basic properties of a platformer character which are - 

               character movement
               basic jump
               double jump
               wall jump
               wall sliding
               gravity control (for better jumping)
               collision detection (for ground and wall detection)
               friction control
               
Components required for script

               ground detector (transform)
               wall detector (transform)
               physicsMaterial2D (friction)
               animator (animation)
               ground layer (to detect ground)
               wall layer (optional - if want particular wall for wall climbing else can use ground layer)
               modifires-
                              slide modifire (for smooth velocity at X axis during jump)
                              gravity modifire (to control low and high jump gravity)
